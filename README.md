# Project Background
GE Electronics, established in 2016, is an international retailer offering electronic products online and in-store across eight countries. The company collects data on its sales, product offerings, customers and operational efficiency. This project analyzes this data to uncover key insights that will improve GE Electronics' performance across its business.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas of business:
- **Sales:** The analysis includes sales, quantity, profit, and cost volumes compared to the previous year, along with monthly sales trends and a breakdown by category, brand, and online versus in-store sales.
- **Customer:** An analysis on the number of customers, spend per customer, order volumes and customer distribution. The top ten customers are highlighted to illustrate their impact on the company's KPIs.
- **Store:** The analysis provides an overview of the stores and their operations, including sales volume, the number of customers and order volumes. KPIs can be viewed at the store level to enhance understanding of individual store performance.
- **Executive Summary:** This shows global KPI trends in the above three key business areas to the management executives. The KPI trends are available since the establishment of GE Electronics in 2016 till February 2021.

The interactive Tableau report can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oyinkansola.osunkoya/viz/GlobalElectronics_17454403238890/ExecutiveSummary).<br>
The Sales, Customer and Store dashboards will be used by the business teams in each country, so country selection in the dashboard filter should be used to view the dashboards for the respective countries. KPIs in the dashboards can be viewed in either United States dollars (USD) or the local currency (LOC) of the respective countries.

# Recommendations
- Marketing and promotional efforts should be strategically intensified during the months of November and December to capitalize on seasonal demand and further drive sales. Initiatives may include the development of holiday gift guides featuring GE Electronics products, the provision of complimentary gift-wrapping services, and the introduction of exclusive holiday discounts and loyalty rewards to enhance customer engagement and conversion.
- Introduce a time-bound discount incentive for customers whose purchases exceed a specified threshold (e.g., USD 15,000 in the U.S. or AUD 5,000 in Australia), to encourage repeat purchases from GE Electronics. While there is a strong base of repeat customers overall, data shows that the majority of top-tier customers in each market tend to make only a single purchase annually. This initiative aims to increase purchase frequency among this high-value segment.
- An analysis of sales per square meter indicates that many larger stores are generating comparable or lower sales than smaller-format locations. To enhance overall store performance and space utilization, it is recommended to evaluate opportunities to reduce store footprints where appropriate. Additionally, underutilized areas can be repurposed for alternative functionsâ€”such as incorporating a compact bakery or convenience section to drive foot traffic, or designating space for online order fulfillment to support online sales growth.
